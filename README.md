# 🧠 Team Role Allocator using Gemini API

This is a web-based AI tool that intelligently assigns **team roles** based on the project title and the list of team members provided by the user. It uses **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model** to suggest roles such as:

- 📌 Project Lead  
- 💻 Developer  
- 🧪 Tester  
- 📝 Documentation  
- 🔍 Researcher

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user opens the web app and enters a **Project Title** and a list of **Team Members**.
2. The app sends this information to Gemini via a crafted **prompt**.
3. Gemini responds with role assignments, which are displayed clearly on the results page.
